# Movies-Recommender-System

### In this Repository, I will be working with the Movie Tweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:
1. Knowledge Based Recommendations 
2. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations 
3. Content Based Recommendations 


### 1. Knowledge Based Recommendations
* Knowledge based recommendations frequently are implemented using filters, and are extremely common amongst luxury based goods. Filters that you might see when purchasing items like cars or homes are examples of knowledge based recommendations. In knowledge based recommendations, users provide information about the types of recommendations they would like back.
* Often a rank based algorithm is provided along with knowledge based recommendations to bring the most popular items in particular categories to the user's attention. In the linke below, you will get some practice implementing this type of recommendation for the MovieTweetings dataset.

### 2.Collaborative filtering
* Collaborative filtering is a method of making recommendations based only on the interactions between users and items. We don't need any information about items and users (information like user like or dislike item, â€¦ will be needed)

for example We know that Rima and Amir both have similar tastes in books. If we recommend a book Rima has read to Amir, this is an example of a...collaborative filtering(see below).
